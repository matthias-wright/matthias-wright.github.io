                <span class="font1">Detection of medical conditions or abnormalities in clinical
                    data has already been achieved by employing discriminative models, especially
                    neural networks. For example, neural networks have been trained as binary
                    classifier to learn a decision boundary that discriminates between normal
                    and abnormal ECG recordings. The training process requires normal as well as
                    abnormal ECG recordings. However, public ECG databases generally consist of
                    many normal recordings and a few abnormal recordings. This circumstance serves
                    as the main incentive behind my bachelor's thesis. Train a generative adversarial
                    network with only normal data.

                <span class="font1">Detection of medical conditions or abnormalities in clinical
                    data has already been achieved by employing discriminative models, especially
                    neural networks. For example, neural networks have been trained as binary
                    classifiers to learn a decision boundary that discriminates between normal
                    and abnormal ECG recordings. The training process requires normal as well as
                    abnormal ECG recordings. However, public ECG databases generally consist of
                    many normal recordings and a few abnormal recordings. This circumstance served
                    as the main incentive behind my bachelor's thesis, train a generative adversarial
                    network with only normal data. I ran two separate experiments. <br/>
                    At first I tried to detect respiratory failure on the basis of blood gas measurements.
                    I trained a generative adversarial network with blood gas measurements from healthy patients.
                    Afterwards, I fed two separate test sets into the trained discriminator. One containing
                    blood gas measurements of healthy patients and the other containing blood gas measurements of
                    patients suffering from respiratory failure. The hope was that because the discriminator was
                    trained only on healthy data, the loss would be larger for the test set containing the
                    examples of patients with respiratory failure. It did, but the difference was not significant
                    from a medical point of view. <br/>
                    I repeated this approach for the other experiment, but I tried to detect cardiac arrhythmia in
                    ECG recordings instead. This time the difference between the two test sets was significant from
                    a medical perspective.

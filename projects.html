                    In this thesis, we introduced a dual autoencoder architecture that aimed to perform image style transfer without
                    explicitly using RGB-pixel representations. Similar to the CycleGAN architecture (Zhu et al. 2017), the goal was to
                    learn a mapping between two image domains. The purpose of the autoencoders was to learn the most important features
                    of the image domains, thus removing non-essential information. The hypothesis was that the low-dimensional representations,
                    learned through the autoencoders, would model images on a level that is semantically higher than pixel representations. <br/>
                    The mapping between the low-dimensional representations was performed by two deep neural networks (generators), one for each direction.
                    Both networks were paired up with a discriminator to form a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We tried both fully-connected neural networks
                    (FCNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the generators. While using FCNNs did not yield visually recognizable style transfer results,
                    we were able to achieve some form of style transfer using CNNs. However, the stylized images were not visually indistinguishable from the images in the corresponding domain. <br/>
                    The results were evaluated quantitatively using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (Heusel et al. 2017). <br/>
                    We concluded that the GANs were likely unable to capture the distribution of the low-dimensional representation of the corresponding domain.

                <span class="font1">Detection of medical conditions or abnormalities in clinical
                    data has already been achieved by employing discriminative models, especially
                    neural networks. For example, neural networks have been trained as binary
                    classifiers to learn a decision boundary that discriminates between normal
                    and abnormal ECG recordings. The training process requires normal as well as
                    abnormal ECG recordings. However, public ECG databases generally consist of
                    many normal recordings and a few abnormal recordings.
                    This circumstance served as the main incentive for my bachelor's thesis project, which was to train a
                    generative adversarial network with only normal data and to then examine whether it would be capable of
                    discriminating between normal and abnormal data. <br/>
                    During my research phase, I conducted two separate experiments. In one experiment, I examined
                    whether generative adversarial networks are capable of detecting cardiac arrhythmia in ECG recordings.
                    For this, I trained a generative adversarial network with normal ECG recordings. Afterwards
                    I fed two separate test sets into the trained discriminator, one containing normal ECG
                    recordings and the other containing arrhythmic ECG recordings. The hypothesis was that,
                    because the discriminator was trained only on normal recordings, the loss would be larger
                    for the test set containing arrhythmic recordings. For the other experiment, I repeated the
                    procedure in order to examine whether generative adversarial networks, when given the blood gas
                    measurements of a patient, can decide whether or not that patient has respiratory failure.
